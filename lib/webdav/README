THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE, DATE: 2005-02-03

These Tcl scripts define two packages:

    webdav      a WebDAV client with a basic file-system like interface
    davvfs      VFS driver for remote mounting of WebDAV servers

This WebDAV client code can be used in a number of ways:

    1)	Using calls to webdav::* procs, as in:

		package require webdav
		set dav [webdav::open http://mysite.org/some/path/]
		puts [webdav::get $dav foo/bar]
		webdav::close $dav

    2)	Via an object command wrapper to do the same:

		package require webdav
		set dav [webdav::connect http://mysite.org/some/path/]
		puts [$dav get foo/bar]
		$dav close

    3)  As a mounted VFS file system:

		package require vfs::dav
		vfs::dav::Mount http://mysite.org/some/path/ mydav
		set fd [open mydav/foo/bar]
		puts [read $fd]
		close $fd
		vfs::unmount mydav

    4)  By registering a new url type handler:

		package require vfs::urltype
		vfs::urltype::Mount dav
		set fd [open dav://mysite.org/some/path/foo/bar]
		puts [read $fd]
		close $fd

The "webdav" package depends on a number of other packages:

    base64      in tcllib
    uri         in tcllib
    TclXML      see http://wiki.tcl.tk/tclxml
    http        modified version from TclSOAP (included here)

The modified http package supports the "-method" option to pass PROPFIND
and other requests as well as chunked transfers and a first cut at supporting
keepalive connections (does not work with webdav yet).  A copy is included
here for convenience, this is a modified version of code by Pat Thoyts.

The "davvfs" package depends on the "vfs" and "webdav" packages, as well as
"vfs::urltype" when registering the "dav:" prefix.  Included here because it
is not part of a standard Tclkit configuration (it's in the full TclVFS pkg)..

Performance is considerably lower with a pure-Tcl XML parser, i.e. if there
is no suitable compiled Tclexpat extension.

The "*.test" scripts use hardcoded server urls and need to be adjusted to run.
All files needed on the server are available in the "davdata.tgz" archive.
