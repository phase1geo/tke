# If this option is set to a directory name, TKE will store various settings
# files/directories in this directory rather than in the default home directory.
# This will allow a user to share the same TKE settings on multiple computers.

{SyncDirectory} {}

# Specifies a whitespace separated list of settings items that will be stored
# in the directory specified by {General/SyncDirectory}.  The values stored in this
# setting will only be used if the {General/SyncDirectory} value is set to a valid
# directory name.  The list of valid values are the following:
#  - emmet       (Custom Emmet aliases)
#  - favorites   (Favorited files/directories)
#  - launcher    (Command launcher data)
#  - plugins     (All plugin data including installed vs. uninstalled)
#  - prefs       (User-specific preferences (includes language-specific preferences))
#  - sessions    (All named session data)
#  - snippets    (Both general and language-specific snippets)
#  - templates   (All user-created file templates)
#  - themes      (All user created and imported theme data)
