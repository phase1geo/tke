## MacOS Desktop

On Mac OS X, the application installation will place the TKE application in the Applications directory.  To launch the application, simply open the Application directory in the Finder and double-click on the application.  This will launch TKE using the same session settings that TKE had when last launched.

You can also start the application using any other method available on your Mac OS X system, including Launchpad, Spotlight, third-party application launchers, etc.

If you want to execute tke from the Terminal on the command-line, you can do so by executing the /Applications/TKE.app/Contents/bin/tke script.  The command-line options can then be used when invoking TKE.
