## Windows

On Windows, the application installation will place TKE in its own subfolder within the Programs directory available through the Start menu.  To launch the application, simply traverse in the program hierarchy to the application icon and double-click it.  This will launch TKE using the same session settings that TKE had when last launched.

Like its Mac OS X counterpart, you can also start the application using any other method available methods normally used for starting an application.
