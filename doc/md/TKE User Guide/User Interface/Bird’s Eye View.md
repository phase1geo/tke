### Bird’s Eye View

The bird’s eye view displays the current file in a read-only fashion using a small font, allowing a large portion of the file to be viewed to help provide context and for visually searching text. When it is displayed, placing the cursor into any portion of it will highlight the currently displayed text within the bird’s eye view. Clicking on the highlighted text in the bird’s eye viewer and dragging up/down will adjust the view in the associated editing buffer. Clicking on any non-selected portion of the bird’s eye view will jump the editing buffer view to center on the clicked line of text. You can adjust the bird’s eye view by using the scroll wheel function of your mouse while the cursor is within the bird’s eye view.

Displaying the view can be handled at three different points:

1. View preference panel
	- Controls default bird’s eye view when the application is started or when new files are opened.
2. View menu
	- Changes the show/hide status of the bird’s eye view for all opened files and will control the status of the bird’s eye view on any newly opened file.
	- Overrides the preference value as long as the application remains open.
3. Tab contexual menu
	- Allows the show/hide status for the current tab.
	- Overrides the previous controls.

In terms of preference control over the bird’s eye view, you can set the character width of the view and the size of the font.
