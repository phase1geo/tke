### Find Highlighting

TKE supports searching within a text window via the “Find” menu.  When a string is searched within the text window, all matching text will be highlighted and the insertion cursor will be placed at the beginning of the first matched text.  This allows you to quickly see all matches within the text window.

When either the “Find” or “Find and Replace” functions are invoked, if text is currently selected in the text window, that text will be automatically placed in the search field.
