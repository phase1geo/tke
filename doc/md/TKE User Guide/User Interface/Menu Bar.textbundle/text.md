## Menu Bar

Below the title bar is the menu bar (on Windows and most Linux distributions).  This contains a list of many of the available features within the tool.  Any functionality that is contained within the listed menus can be assigned a keyboard shortcut, configurable via the menu binding file (see the “Menu Binding” Chapter for more details on the structure of this file).  From left to right, the main menus are as follows:

- File
- Edit
- Find
- View
- Tools
- Sessions
- Plugins
- Help
