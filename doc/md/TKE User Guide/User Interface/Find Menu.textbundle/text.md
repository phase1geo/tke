### Find Menu

The Find menu contains items for searching and, optionally, replacing text in the current file.  It also contains items that can add search text to the current selection and items for finding text in a group of files (regardless if they are currently opened in the editor or not).  The following table contains the items found in this menu along with the description of its functionality.

| Menu Item | Shortcut<br>(Mac) | Shortcut<br>(Other) | Description |
| - | - |
| Find | Cmd-F | Alt-F | Searches the current file for a given regular expression.  The displayed search bar also contains a checkbutton for specifying whether a case sensitive search should be performed or not and a checkbutton for saving the search input.  Using the up/down keys while the input is in the entry field will allow you to traverse the find history and previously saved searches.  Hitting the return key will cause all matches in the current file to be highlighted, the first match after the current cursor to be in view, and the cursor placed at the  beginning of the match. |
| Find Next | Alt-N | Alt-N | Moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the next matched string after the current insertion cursor. |
| Find Previous | Alt-P | Alt-P | Moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the next matched string before the current insertion cursor. |
| Select Current Match | Alt-D | Alt-D | If the insertion cursor is located on a match from a find operation, the matched text will be added to the current selection. If the insertion cursor is not currently on a match, no action will be taken. |
| Select All Matches | Alt-A | Alt-A | Selects all matched occurrences. |
| Find and Replace | Shift-Cmd-F | Shift-Alt-F | Searches the current file for a given regular expression and replaces it with an associated string.  The displayed search and replace bar also contains three checkbuttons:  one for specifying case sensitivity of the match, one for replacing the first match or all matches, and one for saving the search input.  Using the up/down keys will traverse Find/Replace history and previously saved searches.  Hitting the return key will perform the replacement. |

The cursor will be placed on the matched pair.

| Find Next Bracket Mismatch | | | If there is a bracket mismatch after the current insertion cursor, selecting this option will place the insertion cursor on the mismatching curly bracket, square bracket, parenthesis or angled bracket. To enable bracket mismatch highlighting, enable the Editor/HighlightMismatchingChars preference item. |
| Find Previous Bracket Mismatch | | | If there is a bracket mismatch before the current insertion cursor, selecting this option will place the insertion cursor on the mismatching curly bracket, square bracket, parenthesis or angled bracket.
