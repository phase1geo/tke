### Sidebar File Information Panel

When a single file is selected within the sidebar, a special panel will be displayed at the bottom of the sidebar, displaying additional information about the selected file, including the following:

- Name of the file
- Default syntax of the given file
- File size
- Last modification date of file

If the selected file is one that is tracked by a version control system, the current version information is also included in the panel. Additionally, if the selected file is an image file that TKE can display, a thumbnail image of the file will be displayed and the image size is displayed.

When the sidebar loses keyboard focus, the information panel will be hidden until the sidebar gains keyboard focus. If you would prefer that the information panel remain visible at all times, this option can be set within the Preferences window within the View panel using the **Keep file information panel visible when sidebar doesnâ€™t have focus** checkbox.

Additionally, you can toggle the visibility of the file information panel by using either the **View / Show File Info** or **View / Hide File Info** menu option (this will only have an effect during the current session). To set the visibility of the file information panel between sessions, set or clear the **Show File Info** preference option in the View preference panel.
