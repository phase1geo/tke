## Line Number Bar

The line number displays two sets of line numbers, corresponding to the associated line numbers of each file that is part of the difference.  The numbers on the left side correspond to the first file while the numbers on the right side correspond to the second file.  Gaps in line numbers represent differences that the associated file has with the other file.

Like the line number bar in normal editing view, you can click on a set of line numbers to create a marker and you can click and drag in this bar to select all associated lines of text for the purposes of copying.
