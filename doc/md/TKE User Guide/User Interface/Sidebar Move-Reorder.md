### Sidebar Move / Reorder

For directories that are listed in the sidebar, you can now move and reorder files and directories using drag-and-drop within the sidebar.

#### Sidebar Move

To move a file or directory to a new location within the sidebar filesystem, simply click on the file(s) or director(y/ies) that you want to move. After they are selected, click and drag the items to the new directory in which they will be relocated to. A colored marker will be displayed in the sidebar indicating positions in which the items can be dropped.

If the destination directory is not currently in view because the parent directory contents are not being displayed, simply hover the cursor over the parent directory for a second or so while still holding down the mouse button. The parent directory contents will automatically opened for view.

If the destination directory is not in view because it listed above the top or below the bottom of the sidebar, simply move the mouse cursor to the top or bottom of the sidebar while holding down the left mouse button. This will cause the sidebar contents to automatically scroll to make the directory come into view.

#### Sidebar Reordering

By default, all directories listed in the sidebar will be sorted by name in alphabetical order with the exception of folders being listed at the top of the directory contents (if you have that preference option set). However, if you want to manually set the order of the directory contents, you can now do that.

First, change the directory sort option to manual mode by selecting the directory, right-clicking to reveal the contextual menu and select the **Sort / Manually** option. Second, drag and drop the files and/or directories listed in the directory in the desired order. An insertion bar will be displayed to indicate the position of the current drop zone. Alternatively, you can move files within a directory by selecting them and then use the Alt-Up/Down keyboard command to move the file up/down the directory listing. TKE will create a file in the manually sorted directory called ".tkesort" which contains the information to remember the sorted order of the directory contents so that subsequent launches of TKE will properly remember and display the manually sorted order of the directory contents.

If you wish to change the sort order back to "By Name" at any point, select the directory to change and select the **Sort / By Name** option. This will redisplay the directory to list files/directories by name within the directory; however, if you ever wish to go back to using a manually sorted order, the last manually sorted order is still remembered and will be used.
