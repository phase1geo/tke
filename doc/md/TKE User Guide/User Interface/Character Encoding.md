### Character Encoding

To the right of the message area in the information bar is the character encoding menu for the current tab's contents. When text is read from the file, TKE currently makes no attempt to understand the required character encoding of the file, instead applying the default encoding used by the system. If your file requires a specific encoding, select that encoding from this menu by clicking on the encoding button. This will redisplay the file using the given encoding and will save the file with that encoding whenever the file is saved.

Encoding information is remembered for an opened file between sessions. Whenever a new file is opened, the default encoding value for the system will be used.

The character encoding for the current editing buffer can also be changed using the `File / Encoding` menu option.
