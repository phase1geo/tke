### Sidebar Information Panel

When a single file or directory is selected within the sidebar, a special panel will be displayed at the bottom of the sidebar, displaying additional information about the selected item, including the following:

- Basename of the file/directory
- Default syntax of the given file
- File size
- Last modification date of file/directory
- Read, write, execute permissions of file/directory
- File/directory owner
- File/directory group
- Favorited status of the file/directory

If the selected file is one that is tracked by a version control system, the current version information is also included in the panel. Additionally, if the selected file is an image file that TKE can display, a thumbnail image of the file will be displayed along with the image size. All information displayed in the panel can be shown/hidden within the **Info Panel** tab of the sidebar preference panel.

When the sidebar loses keyboard focus, the information panel will be hidden until the sidebar gains keyboard focus. If you would prefer that the information panel remain visible at all times, this option can be set within the Preferences window within the Sidebar panel using the **Keep file information panel visible when sidebar doesnâ€™t have focus** checkbox.

Additionally, you can toggle the visibility of the file information panel by using either the **View / Show Info Panel** or **View / Hid Info Panel** menu option (this will only have an effect during the current session). To set the visibility of the file information panel between sessions, set or clear the **Show Info Panel** preference option in the View preference panel.
