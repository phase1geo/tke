### Sharing and Downloading New Themes

You can now share a theme with the rest of the world via the TKE theme webpage found [here](http://tke.sourceforge.net/themes.html). To  upload a theme, create a .tkethemz package mentioned in the previous Button Action Bar section and send it via e-mail to phase1geo at gmail dot com. Please allow up to 24 hours before the theme is available from the website.

From this same webpage, you can peruse other submitted themes and download them to your local computer.  Just as it was mentioned in the above section, you can install the theme by clicking on the Theme Editor, clicking the "Open" button at the bottom of the window, clicking the "Import" button, selecting the theme from the dialog window and clicking the "Open" button in the dialog window. Once the theme has been imported, you can choose to use this theme from the Preferences window within the Appearances panel.

Speaking of which, you can always quickly access the TKE theme webpage from within the Appearances panel by clicking on the "Get Themes" button.
