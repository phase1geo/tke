## Reloading Plugins

Reloading plugins is only necessary in two cases. In the first case, the user installs a new plugin in the TKE installation’s “plugins” directory. In this case, the plugins will need to be reloaded so that the new plugin name will be viewable in the plugin install list without requiring an application restart. The second case where plugin reloading is needed is in plugin development (more on this process is described in the “Plugin Development” chapter within this document).

To reload plugins, simply select the “Plugins / Reload” menu command. This will cause all plugins to be immediately reloaded. No application restart is necessary.
