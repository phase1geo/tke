## Searching a Language-Specific Website

In addition to viewing a static website, TKE also allows you to quickly and easily perform custom website searches. To perform a website search, simply select the `Help` menuâ€™s `Search References` option. This will display a documentation search panel at the bottom of the main window. A representation of that panel is shown below.

When the panel is displayed, the keyboard focus will be on the website name to search. To change the website to search, either click the name and select from one of the other available websites or press the spacebar and use the arrow keys to navigate the popup menu. To specify the string to search for, click on the entry field (or use the Tab key to move from the website selection menubutton to the entry field) and enter the search text. To immediately perform the search, hit the Enter/Return key. Doing so will launch your default web browser, displaying the website with the search string embedded in the URL.

If you wish to cancel the documentation search enter the Escape key when the search panel has keyboard focus or click on the close button on the far right side of the panel.

It is important to note that you will only be allowed to close the panel with the Return key only if a search string is entered in the entry field.

### Saved Searches

If the searched string/website combination is one that you will be performing often, you can save the documentation search by clicking on the  `Save` check button prior to closing the search panel.
