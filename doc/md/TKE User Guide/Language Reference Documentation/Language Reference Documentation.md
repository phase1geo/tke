# Language Reference Documentation

When editing a file in a given syntax, you may lookup reference material associated with the file’s language syntax using TKE’s built-in language reference feature.  Each supported syntax description can have one or more sources of documentation associated with it and the user can also specify other online sources of documentation associated with a particular language in preferences. This feature can be a tremendous asset and time-saver while coding.
