#### Title Bar

The title bar displays the name of the theme that is currently being edited. If the current theme was previously imported and contains attribution information (i.e., the name of the creator and/or creator’s website) the attribution information will also be displayed in the title bar.

In addition to this theme information, the title bar also displays the modified status of the theme. Whenever you make a savable change to the theme, the character between “Theme Editor” and the name of the theme will change to an asterisk (\*). When the theme is saved, this character will be changed to a dash (-) character indicating that the theme contains no unsaved changes.

Finally, to exit the theme editor, use the title bar window quit button. If the theme has unsaved changes, a prompt will be displayed allowing you to save the changes prior to exiting the window (or you can cancel the quit operation through this prompt as well).
