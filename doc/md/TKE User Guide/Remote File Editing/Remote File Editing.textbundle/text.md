# Remote File Editing

In addition to the ability to view/edit files on the local file system and across an NFS mounted drive, TKE also has the ability to view/edit files natively on remote systems using FTP/SFTP/WebDAV.  To edit remote files, use the File / Open Remoteâ€¦ menu option to display the remote file dialog window.  A depiction of this window is displayed below.

The window is comprised of three areas:

1. Connection bookmark sidebar (left)
2. Remote file viewer (right)
3. Button bar (bottom)
