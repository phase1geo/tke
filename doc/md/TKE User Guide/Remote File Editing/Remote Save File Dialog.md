## Remote Save File Dialog

If you want to save an existing editing buffer to a remote server, select the File / Save Remote As… menu option.  This will display the remote save file dialog window.  This window will look almost identical to the remote open file dialog window with two exceptions.  In the button bar, a “New Folder” button will be available.  Clicking on this button when a directory is displayed in the remote file viewer will display a new folder popup window allowing you to specify the name of the new folder.  The new folder will be added to the current remote directory.

Additionally, an entry field is displayed allowing you to specify the filename to save to.  Clicking the “Save” button will save the specified filename into the currently selected directory.  This will also cause the remote directory to be added to the main window sidebar (if it does not already exist there).  Once the file has been saved to the remote server, you may continue to edit the file and save it — the saves will be pushed to the remote file server automatically.
