## Uninstalling on Windows

To delete TKE on Windows, find the directory where the tke.exe file was installed during the installation process and simply delete this directory.

This command will not remove your TKE home directory, however.  If you want to remove that directory, open the file explorer, locate your home directory, and delete the .tke home directory found there.

Deleting the TKE home directory will permanently delete all preferences, installed themes, installed plugins and other important files created and maintained by TKE.
