## Installing for Windows

The easiest installation process for Windows is fairly straightforward and creates a native Windows application on your machine. Download the TKE Windows executable installer from the SourceForge website, run the resulting download file, and follow the installation wizard steps.  The application will then be available through the start window and, if enabled in the installation process, through a desktop shortcut.

You can alternatively install a Unix-like environment such as Cygwin and then install the tarball in a similar manner to installing for Linux (with the exception that Cygwin does not have a software update tool like ‘apt-get’ but rather maintains its own software packages available through the Cygwin installer).  The process of installing Cygwin and configuring its environment properly for TKE is beyond the scope of this document.

It is important to note that on Windows, the in-app update mechanism is not available.  Only stable releases of TKE will be available and only from the SourceForge website.  Updating the application will require downloading and running the new installer.
