## Uninstalling a Plugin

Uninstalling a plugin is similar to the process of installing a plugin. Select the “Plugins / Uninstall…”
menu command. This will display the command launcher in plugin uninstallation mode. Any installed
plugins will be displayed in the launcher. To uninstall a plugin from the list, simply select a plugin
name from the list or begin typing a portion of the plugin name in the entry field until it is selected,
and hit the RETURN key.

This will cause the plugin to be immediately uninstalled. No application restart is required.
