## Installing a Plugin

Installing a new plugin is accomplished from the “Plugins / Install…” menu command. Doing so will
display the command launcher in plugin installation mode. Any uninstalled plugins will be displayed
in the launcher. To install a plugin from the list, simply select a plugin name from the list or begin
typing a portion of the plugin name in the entry field until it is selected, and hit the RETURN key.

This will cause the plugin to be immediately installed. No application restart is required.
