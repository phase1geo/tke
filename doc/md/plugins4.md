## Showing Installed Plugin Usage Information

You can view the list of currently installed plugins using the “Plugins / Show Installed…” menu
command. Doing so will display the command launcher with the list of currently installed plugins. To
the right of the list the currently selected plugin’s information will be displayed in the preview window.
If a plugin is selected in the list and the plugin contains usage information, it will be displayed
in a read-only editing buffer.
