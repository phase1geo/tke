#### The Regular Expression Checker Plugin

This plugin allows the user to test regular expression syntax against text.  The
results of the regular expression match are performed immediately as pattern
text is entered in the entry field at the top of the window.  Additionally, if
any variables are assigned a value, those variables and values are displayed
in the variable table shown at the bottom of the window.

Matched text will be highlighted to help you understand exactly which text is
being matched.  If no text is matched, no text will be highlighted.

Once you have entered the desired regular expression, you can copy the expression
to the clipboard using the **Copy** button.

Finally, if you select any text in an editing buffer and then start the plugin
via the **Plugins** window, that text will automatically be copied into the
text box of the resulting window.
